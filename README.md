The focus of our simulation study is to explore the effects of the curse of dimensionality within the classical statistical method of linear regression.

The curse of dimensionality refers to issues that occur specifically when utilizing high dimensional data. The term curse of dimensionality originated from Richard E. Bellmenâ€™s exploration of dynamic programming in 1957. The dimensionality of a dataset refers to the number of predictors/features included in the model. The topic of the curse of dimensionality grew in popularity with the rise of computational power and machine learning. While the effects of the curse of dimensionality have important ramifications for machine learning methods such as K-nearest neighbors, Bayesian models, and others, the scope of the problem extends far beyond those topics into other aspects of the data and statistical framework.
